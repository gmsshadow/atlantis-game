gate lore [GATE] 1: Gate Lore is the art of detecting and using

  numbered in order, but spread out randomly, so there is no
  correlation between the Gate number and the Gate's location. A mage
  with skill 1 in Gate Lore can see a Gate if one exists in the same
  region as the mage. This detection is automatic; the Gate will
  appear in the region report. A mage with skill 1 in Gate Lore may
  also jump through a Gate into another region on the same level
  containing a gate, selected at random. To use Gate Lore in this
  manner, use the syntax CAST Gate_Lore RANDOM UNITS <unit> ... UNITS
  is followed by a list of units to follow the mage through the Gate
  (the mage always jumps through the Gate). At level 1, the mage may

  gate (the mage always jumps through the gate). At level 3, the mage

farsight [FARS] 1: A mage with this skill may obtain region reports on
  distant regions. The report will be as if the mage was in the
  distant region himself. The target region must be within 4 times the
  caster's skill level squared regions of the caster. Coordinates of
  locations not on the surface are scaled to the surface coordinates
  for this calculation. Attempting to view across different levels
  increases the distance by 4 per level difference. To use this skill,
  CAST Farsight REGION <x> <y> <z> where <x>, <y>, and <z> are the
  coordinates of the region that you wish to view. If you omit the <z>
  coordinate, the <z> coordinate of the caster's current region will
  be used. The <z> coordinate for the surface is '1' and the
  <z>-coordinate for the underworld is '2'. Note that Farsight cannot
  be used either into or out of the Nexus. Note that Farsight does not
  work in conjunction with other skills or spells; the mage can only
  rely on his normal facilities while casting Farsight. This skill
  requires pattern [PATT] 1 and spirit [SPIR] 1 to begin to study.
  This skill costs 100 silver per month of study.

  must be within 2 times the caster's skill level squared regions of
  the caster. Coordinates of locations not on the surface are scaled
  to the surface coordinates for this calculation. Attempting to view
  across different levels increases the distance by 4 per level
  difference. To use this skill, CAST Teleportation REGION <x> <y> <z>
  where <x>, <y>, and <z> are the coordinates of the region that you
  wish to teleport to. If you omit the <z> coordinate, the <z>
  coordinate of the caster's current region will be used. The <z>
  coordinate for the surface is '1' and the <z>-coordinate for the
  underworld is '2'. Note that Teleportation cannot be used either
  into or out of the Nexus. This skill requires gate lore [GATE] 1 and
  farsight [FARS] 3 to begin to study. This skill costs 100 silver per

  caster must be trained in Portal Lore. The caster may teleport units
  weighing up to 50 weight units times his skill level, to the target
  mage's region.  The target region must be within 2 times the
  caster's skill level squared regions of the caster. To use this
  skill, CAST Portal_Lore <target> UNITS <unit> ..., where <target> is
  the unit number of the target mage, and <unit> is a list of units to
  be teleported (the casting mage may teleport himself, if he so
  desires). This skill requires gate lore [GATE] 3 and farsight [FARS]
  1 to begin to study. This skill costs 100 silver per month of study.

  Weather Lore also allows further study into more powerful areas of
  magic. The weather may be predicted for 3 months at level 1, 6
  months at level 3 and a full year at level 5. The target region must
  be within 4 times the caster's skill level squared regions of the
  caster. Coordinates of locations not on the surface are scaled to
  the surface coordinates for this calculation. Attempting to view
  across different levels increases the distance by 4 per level
  difference. To use this skill, CAST Weather_Lore REGION <x> <y> <z>
  where <x>, <y>, and <z> are the coordinates of the region where you
  wish to predict the weather. If you omit the <z> coordinate, the <z>
  coordinate of the caster's current region will be used. The <z>
  coordinate for the surface is '1' and the <z>-coordinate for the
